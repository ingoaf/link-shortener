1. What is the expected load on the system? (additionally: public/private?)
2. Are the links allowed to expire? (if yes, ttl?)
3. How many links will presumably be stored?
4. What is the variation in the links or are there any link patterns (query/path parameters?)
5. In which format is the URL received at encode and decode endpoints?
